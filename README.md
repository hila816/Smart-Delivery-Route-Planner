Weighted Graph
 A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. 
 Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs. 

Representation of Graph Data Structure:
There are multiple ways to store a graph: The following are the most common representations.

1. Adjacency Matrix
In this method, the graph is stored in the form of the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices.

2. Adjacency List
 This graph is represented as a collection of linked lists. There is an array of pointer which points to the edges connected to that vertex.
